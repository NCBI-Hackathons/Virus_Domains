# Virus_Domains
A NYGC Hackathon Project to Discover and Leverage New Viral Protein Domains

VIROME_SNIFF is a pipeline that searches Next Generation Sequencing reads using NCBI magicBLAST tool using virus protein database. 
This tool finds already known viral sequences and viruses-like proteins and discovers knew Viral Protein Domains in any single genome or metagenome sequence pool. 


#WORKFLOW
1. Detecting NGS sequences for virus using NCBI magicBLAST/k-mers
2. Assemble matched reads
3. Detect
